<p>Welcome to my corner of the internet. On this site, you'll find recent
  articles I've written, mostly about coding. Below, you'll find the most
  recent articles, but you can browse all of them over on the
  <a href="/archive.html">archive</a>.

  You can also view the web-version of my
  <a href="/resume.html" target="_blank">resume</a> as well as see a listing
  of (what I think) are my most interesting current projects in my
  <a href="/portfolio.html">portfolio</a>.
