      The current website you're looking at was written in Haskell using Hakyll.
      The posts are written in markdown, while the pages are written using HTML
      and CSS. Site features such as draft posts (which you obviously can't see) are
      implemented using Haskell.

      My resume was written in pure HTML and CSS and was designed specifically
      to look good printed to PDF.
