      A simple SPA that takes a simple human-readible list of things you'd
      like to accomplish and returns a prioritized agenda of those items, along
      with an explanation of that prioritization.

      The current website you're looking at was written in Haskell using Hakyll.
      The posts are written in markdown, while the pages are written using HTML
      and CSS. Site features such as draft posts (which you obviously can't see) are
      implemented using Haskell.
