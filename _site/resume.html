            Drove many initiatives to completion which were previously stalled at the ideation stage. These initiatives
            included
            everything from implementing long-standing feature requests, removing bottle necks in the sales funnel, and

            communication across departments.

            Wrote compiler that took an obscure language as input and produced human-readable, canonical react

            reduced the
            time required to release new frontend features.
