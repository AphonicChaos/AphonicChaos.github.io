    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my corner of the internet. On this site, you'll find recent
  articles I've written, mostly about coding. Below, you'll find the most
  recent articles, but you can browse all of them over on the
  <a href="./archive.html">archive</a>.
</p>
<p>
  You can also view the web-version of my
  <a href="./resume.html" target="_blank">resume</a> as well as see a listing
  of (what I think) are my most interesting current projects in my
  <a href="./portfolio.html">portfolio</a>.

            <strong>Bookworm - March 20, 2025</strong>
            
            <p><p>The first game that I’d like to create with the game engine that I [wrote about
yesterday][/posts/2025-03-19-patina] is a game I’m calling “Bookworm”. The plan
is for it to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)">Snake</a>,
but with a twist</p>

            <strong>Patina - March 19, 2025</strong>
            
            <p><p>I got the idea for a game a few days ago. I started prototyping it using the DOM
and absolutely positioned elements before I realized I was better off using
proper tools for the job. As such, I decided to dust off a book I bought a
couple of years ago and write my own 2D game engine, which I’m calling “Patina”.</p>

            <strong>Just a Tease - March 14, 2025</strong>
            
            <p><p>I just wanted to add teasers to the <a href="./">home page</a>. After many attempts, and
many failures, I resolved to look for another static site generator; one that
felt less magical; one that I could wrap my head around.</p>
