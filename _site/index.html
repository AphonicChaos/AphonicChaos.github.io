    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my corner of the internet. On this site, you'll find recent
  articles I've written, mostly about coding. Below, you'll find the most
  recent articles, but you can browse all of them over on the

  You can also view the web-version of my

  of (what I think) are my most interesting current projects in my

            <strong>Camera, No Lights or Action - March 25, 2025</strong>
            
            <p><p>I finished chapter 3 today, in which I implemented a camera
for my game engine, so that <code>Renderable</code> objects can be positioned conveniently
using a coordinate system that makes more intuitive system for the game being
built, rather than the native to
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API/WebGL_model_view_projection">WebGL</a>.</p>

            <strong>Structure - March 24, 2025</strong>
            
            <p><p>I think the one thing I learned during my brief time in the military is the
importance of structure. I don’t think I would have been able to complete a
self-paced, 2-year MBA program without structure. I wouldn’t have been able to
maintain a 40-hour work week and effectively study and pass the LSAT without
structure. As I look for a new job, I’m thinking that one way I can be more
effective is to add more structure.</p>

            <strong>Bookworm - March 20, 2025</strong>
            
            <p><p>The first game that I’d like to create with the game engine that I [wrote about
yesterday][/posts/2025-03-19-patina] is a game I’m calling “Bookworm”. The plan
is for it to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)">Snake</a>,
but with a twist</p>
