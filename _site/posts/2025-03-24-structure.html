        <p>I think the one thing I learned during my brief time in the military is the
importance of structure. I don’t think I would have been able to complete a
self-paced, 2-year MBA program without structure. I wouldn’t have been able to
maintain a 40-hour work week and effectively study and pass the LSAT without
structure. As I look for a new job, I’m thinking that one way I can be more
effective is to add more structure.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Every week since being let go, I’ve put in at <em>least</em> ten applications a week.
I’ve started working on a few side projects in the hopes that my portfolio will
stop looking like a ghost town, and I put together this website after sitting on
the domain for years. Still, though, I find myself with too much time on my
hands to worry about the future, and not as much progress on my various projects
as I’d like to see.</p>
<h2 id="old-habits">Old Habits</h2>
<p>I had a hunch a week or so ago, and it really hit me to day that a lack of
structure – a lack of routine – is likely a huge contributing factor to these
feelings of anxiety. Thanks to being <a href="https://www.wgu.edu/">WGU</a> alumni, I’ve
got free access to LinkedIn learning. The plan over the next few weeks is to
structure my day similarly to how I did when I was in school, dedicating blocks
of time to applying for jobs, completing online courses, and building my
projects.</p>
<h2 id="high-level-goals">High-Level Goals</h2>
<p>I’m a big believer in the power of <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/blog/productivity/how-to-write-smart-goals">SMART
goals</a>,
but also think it’s good to start with high-level goals when you’re first
setting out. Broadly speaking, I’d like to accomplish the following with
whatever schedule I land on:</p>
<h3 id="write-more">Write more</h3>
<p>One thing that’s kept me from blogging all these years, despite giving
public and internal talks, writing piles of documentation, proposals, and
specifications, etc. has been a concern about if what I put out into the
ether is <em>useful</em>.</p>
<p>What I’ve come to realize is that you never really know what’s going to be
useful to different people, so I should <em>just write</em>. I can eventually make
judicious use of tags to help people find the content they’re most interested
in.</p>
<p>Heck, maybe I’ll even get around to writing that book I keep saying I want to
write…</p>
<h3 id="learn-more">Learn more</h3>
<p>While I often found myself learning every day on the job, I was always learning
something I <em>needed</em> to learn in order to solve a given problem at work, rather
than something I was <em>interested</em> in learning. While learning on-the-job
tickles an important part of the brain, I’m now finding that my bookshelf is
stacked full of books covering topics of interest that I never made it to.</p>
<p>Thus, I want to make a more deliberate effort to balance learning things i need
to know with things I’m interested to know. The short list of those things at
the moment includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>compiler engineering</li>
<li>user experience (UX)</li>
<li>game development</li>
<li>low-level programming</li>
<li>career advancement</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="do-more">Do more</h3>
<p>A lot of the work I’ve done over the last several years have been invisible;
proprietary code that advanced the businesses I worked for, but can’t be shared
elsewhere. The net result is that my GitHub looks like a graveyard. I’ve also
development, low-level programming)
AI scraping my content to either train on or be used to solicit.</p>
<p>I’ve got a lot of half-baked ideas sitting on my hard drive, so I’d like to
commit to actually polishing those enough to present them to the world. If I’ve
learned anything from working at several start-ups, it’s that no one expects
polish at first. As the old saying goes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Perfect is the enemy of good</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The hope is that I learn more, I can do more, and then write about what I’ve
done. I’ve already written briefly about
<a href="https://github.com/AphonicChaos/patina-game-engine">Patina</a>, the game engine
that I’m working on. I’m also working on a static site generator, which I intend
to write about soon, and just started a couple of courses, one on data science,
and another on UX design.</p>
<h3 id="say-less">Say less</h3>
<p>Talk is cheap, as they say, so my plan for the next few series of blog posts is
to talk less about what I’m going to do, and talk more about what I’m doing.</p>
<p>Until then, see you next time.</p>
