        <h2 id="or-rather-site-plans.">Or rather: Site plans.</h2>
<p>My plans for this site aren’t very grand. They are very intentional, though. You
see, I wrote this site in <a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a>
using <a href="https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/">Hakyll</a>.</p>
<p>It wasn’t always, though. I spent
a good few hours with <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a> and
<a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/">Gatsby</a> before ultimately deciding that was too much
magic and extra bloat for what I wanted.</p>
<p>At the moment, it’s little more than the default template with
syntax-highlighting fixed, but I have plans. Those plans mirror a saying I came
up with and have repeated over the years:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Make it work.
Make it fast.
Make it pretty.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And, for optional, extra emphasis:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In that order.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What I mean is that we often spend too much time concerned with how pretty an
app is, prioritizing form over function. Not only does a customer not care that
a site is pretty if it turns out not to work, but I’ve found that it’s far to
easy to lose countless hours adjusting the appearance of something. So much so
that once you’re finally happy to move on to implementing functionality, you’re
short on time and have to cut corners.</p>
<p>As for speed, things only need to be preceptively fast enough. That is, if the
user doesn’t notice that you made a process take microseconds instead of
milliseconds, then the optimization didn’t truly matter. So really, when I say
“make it fast”, what I’m really saying is “make it fast enough”. The reason this
step doesn’t come after make it pretty is because often, shiny UIs need to feel
snappy, so you have to pay attention to speed so that you don’t end up with a
beauty that tags ages to load.</p>
<hr />
<p>So, for this site, I want to do the same thing.</p>
<h3 id="make-it-work">Make it work</h3>
<p>This is actually a bit of a double entendre. Not only do I mean that I have a
set of features that I would like to implement, but that I’d like to use the
evolution of this website as a portfolio piece to send along with my job
applications going forward. As I implement features, I’ll write short posts
explaining the changes I’ve made along with screenshots.</p>
<p>At the moment, the main pages I have planned are:
- The blog, which you’re reading now
- A portfolio that lists any projects I want to highlight
- An online version of my resume</p>
<h3 id="make-it-fast">Make it fast</h3>
<p>As a static website, it’s already going to be plenty fast. So in this case, I’m
bending the definition of “make it fast” to mean “get everything up and running
quickly”. The more content I can create for this blog, the more I’ll have to
show employers, and the more samples I’ll have to draw from as I think about how
best to style this site.</p>
<h3 id="make-it-pretty">Make it pretty</h3>
<p>In addition to moving away from the default theme to something more <em>me</em>, I’d
like to go over my resume again and see what can be cleaned up, since I styled
it ages ago. I’ll also be looking to see if I can add more interactivity to some
plages, like my portfolio, and perhaps add some interactive Easter eggs to the
site if I’m feeling up to it.</p>
<h2 id="on-iterating">On Iterating</h2>
<p>One thing that’s probably worth pointing out that nothing about my motto
precludes iterating or moving quickly. That is, “make it work” doesn’t imply
that the entire project needs to be complete before you can move on to “make it
work” or “make it pretty”. Instead, you consider whatever unit of work makes
sense.</p>
<p>If you’re working on a feature and are blocked by some dependency that another
team is working on, that’s a good time to move on to the other steps. If you
just finished a bit of functionality, whether that’s finishing an endpoint or
wiring up a view, that’s a perfect time to finish the other steps!</p>
<p>–</p>
<p>All of that being said, I think it’s time to finish adding those missing pages.</p>
