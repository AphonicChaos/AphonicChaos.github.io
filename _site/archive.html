            <strong>Structure - March 24, 2025</strong>
            
            <p><p>I think the one thing I learned during my brief time in the military is the
importance of structure. I don’t think I would have been able to complete a
self-paced, 2-year MBA program without structure. I wouldn’t have been able to
maintain a 40-hour work week and effectively study and pass the LSAT without
structure. As I look for a new job, I’m thinking that one way I can be more
effective is to add more structure.</p>

            <strong>Bookworm - March 20, 2025</strong>
            
            <p><p>The first game that I’d like to create with the game engine that I [wrote about
yesterday][/posts/2025-03-19-patina] is a game I’m calling “Bookworm”. The plan
is for it to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)">Snake</a>,
but with a twist</p>

            <strong>Patina - March 19, 2025</strong>
            
            <p><p>I got the idea for a game a few days ago. I started prototyping it using the DOM
and absolutely positioned elements before I realized I was better off using
proper tools for the job. As such, I decided to dust off a book I bought a
couple of years ago and write my own 2D game engine, which I’m calling “Patina”.</p>

            <strong>Just a Tease - March 14, 2025</strong>
            
            <p><p>I just wanted to add teasers to the <a href="./">home page</a>. After many attempts, and
many failures, I resolved to look for another static site generator; one that
felt less magical; one that I could wrap my head around.</p>

            <strong>Polyglot for Life - March 13, 2025</strong>
            
            <p><p>For as long as I can remember, I’ve been interested in languages. Not only
spoken language (I once was a Korean linguist in the military), but also
programming languages.</p>

            <strong>A Plan in Sight - March 12, 2025</strong>
            
            <p><h4 id="or-rather-site-plans.">Or rather: Site plans.</h4>
<p>My plans for this site aren’t very grand. They are very intentional, though. You
see, I wrote this site in <a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a> using
<a href="https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/">Hakyll</a>.</p>

            <strong>Keeping Busy - March 11, 2025</strong>
            
            <p><p>I’ve been trying to keep busy after losing my job last week. Aside from
submitting about ten applications a day, I’ve been doing a <em>lot</em> of exploring.</p>
